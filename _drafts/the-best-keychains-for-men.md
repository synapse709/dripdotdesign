### The best keychain for men - The Mehlville by the James Brand

The team behind the James Brand has demonstrated product after product how much they care about crafting functional and sturdy _EDC_ (everyday carry) tools.

If we had to pick one EDC accessory from the James Brand, it would be The Mehlville. This keychain is a carabiner carved from a solid piece of aluminum. Making it strong and light at the same time.

A functional design for a carabiner built like a tank.

We love the buttery smooth opening and closing of the carabiner gates. Because details matter, the James Brand added a bottle opener function to the Mehlville.

The Mehlville deserves its place among the **best keychains for men**.

### Keyhook in Raw Brass

As we like to say, less is more. This keychain is stripped down from everything to focus on its main function; keeping your keys together.

A low number of keychains were produced from casted raw brass. Due to the nature of this material, the Keyhook will gain a nice patina over time.

This Taylor Stitch keychain is not bulky and will look great no matter what you wear. You could try for example a [**denim shirt**](https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=1309&url=38195) or [**trousers**](https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=1309&url=38193) from Taylor Stitch.

If you enjoy brass EDC, check out this great brass bottle opener from [**Craighill**](https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=1309&url=38196). It's a manly piece of art.

While we are not thrilled by the design of this keychain, we can only praise it for its functionality. This keychain could one day save your life. No kidding!

REQME designed this keychain to cute your seatbelt and shatters your car’s glass in the event of a car accident.

With the help of Velcro, you can fix them within hand reach from you and your passengers. Safety first.
