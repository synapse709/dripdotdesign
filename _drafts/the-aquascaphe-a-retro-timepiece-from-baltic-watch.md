# The Aquascaphe diving watch; a retro timepiece by Baltic Watch

## Dive back into the past with the Aquascaphe

If you are a watch enthusiast you must be familiar with the brand Baltic. Back in 2018, this french microbrand launched its first timepieces on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The HMS 001 and the BICOMPAX 001 were a real success. Within 30 days, Baltic raised EUR 514,806 from 1,044 backers.

Fast-forwarding to 2018, Baltic launched its third watch; a dive watch named Aquascaphe. This time, Baltic Watch released the watch without the help of Kickstarter. The pre-orders were taken directly on the Baltic website.

Let's dive into the _Aquascaphe diving watch_.

### Going vintage with the Aquascaphe by Baltic Watch

We all agree that the Aquascaphe has a nice vintage feel. What we like in this watch is the little details that make a big difference. For instance, the triangle-shaped markers 3, 6 and 9 sandwich-style markers while the marker 12 is printed. It is a unique combination for a dial and we like it.  
If you like your diver with a stainless steel bracelet, you will fore sure like the one coming with the **Aquasquaphe diving watch** for an extra US$87. It is a BOR bracelet (beads-of-rice) that will sit comfortably on your wrist.

The absence of the date window is a feature we like. It gives simplicity and harmony to the dial.
