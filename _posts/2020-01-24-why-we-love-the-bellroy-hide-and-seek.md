## Our Top 3 Gear Choices from Bellroy

Are you tired of your bulky wallet? How about that poorly designed phone case? The time to upgrade your style has arrived.

We handpicked the top 3 products from Bellroy you should own, including the Bellroy Hide and Seek. They look good, are durable and feel great to carry around.

Bellroy was created in 2010 by a group of Australian friends who were frustrated in their need to carry bulky wallets. Unable to find what they were looking for, they launched Bellroy with the aim to create timeless accessories to improve the way people travel and carry their most prized belongings.

### The Bellroy Hide and Seek; a slim and minimalist wallet

The **Bellroy Hide and Seek** wallet is an RFID protected, stylish bifold wallet. This slim wallet is made with top-grade environmentally-friendly, vegetable-tanned leather. Unlike other wallets made with hard leather, the **_Bellroy Hide and Seek_** features a soft leather that will develop a beautiful patina over time. This patina will provide a unique look to your everyday carry (EDC).

Bellroy's logo is on the external front panel. Made with metal, the owl-shaped logo creates a nice contrast of texture between the leather and the metal.

Separate colors were chosen for the inside, outside, and in the thread stitching. _Bellroy_ is playing with contrasts to give a novel look to the _Bellroy_ _Hide and Seek_.

#### A practical solution for your cards and cash

Bellroy designed the Hide and Seek wallet to allow you to carry your cash and cards discreetly.

In addition to its 5 visible card slots, the wallet has one additional secret slot located in the secondary cash compartment. This cash compartment is concealed by a thin leather flap, allowing you to hide extra banknotes and cards. Now you know why this wallet was named the **Hide and Seek**.

We love this secondary cash pouch as we can use it to carry foreign currencies when traveling abroad.

Like all Bellroy accessories, the Hide and Seek comes with a 3-year international warranty.

### The Bellroy Note Sleeve

Carry more without sacrificing style. If a minimalist wallet like the Hide and Seek is not enough, the **Bellroy Note Sleeve** is for you. This is not your usual bulky wallet. Thanks to its well-thought-out design, this bi-fold wallet can hold a lot, while still maintaining a minimal, sleek exterior.

#### Small details for a strong impression

This RFID-protected wallet is made with environmentally friendly vegetable-tanned leather, available in multiple color options. Like with the Hide and Seek, the Note Sleeve is made with two different leather colors (external/internal) to create a nice contrast of colors.

Unlike the Hide and Seek, there is no steel owl on the Note Sleeve. Instead, the Bellroy brand is stamped onto the leather.

#### When style meets practicality

Open your Note Sleeve to grab one of your 3 most important cards. For us, that'd be a credit card, a metro card, or our gym membership. Tuck away the other cards in a compartment that includes an easy-access pull tab. You can carry up to 11 cards in the Bellroy Note Sleeve. That’s more than enough to store your credit cards, gym membership, subway pass, ID cards, or frequent flyer cards.

Inside the pouch dedicated to banknotes, you will find a compartment for your business cards as well as a pocket to store coins. This wallet has everything you need.

The Bellroy Note Sleeve comes with a 3-year international warranty.

In our opinion, there is only one thing missing to make the Bellroy Note Sleeve the best wallet in the market; a small compartment to carry a micro USB or an additional sim card (for travelers).
